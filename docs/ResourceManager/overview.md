# Overview of Azure PowerShell

Azure PowerShell cmdlets provide support for the following Azure services:

* [Azure Resource Manager](/azps-concepts/ref/resourcemanager/)

    Azure Resource Manager is the preferred deployment method for creating and managing Azure
    resources. This module enables you to work with your Azure resources using the Azure Resource
    Manager deployment model.

* [Azure Service Management](/azps-concepts/ref/servicemanagement/)

    Azure Service Management is the classic deployment model. This module allows you to work with
    you classic Azure deployments that have not been converted to Azure Resource Manager. Any new
    deployments should use the Azure Resource Manager methods.

## Install and configure

To use the cmdlets, you need to install and configure Azure PowerShell to connect it to your
account. For more information, see [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](install-azureps.md).

## Getting started

The Azure PowerShell cmdlets perform most of the same functions available in the Azure portal
interface. You should have a basic working knowledge Azure to be successful using the cmdlets. For
more information about Azure, consult the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/).
