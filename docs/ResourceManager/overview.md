# Overview of Azure PowerShell

Azure PowerShell cmdlets provide support for the following Azure services:

* [Azure Resource Manager](/powershell/resourcemanager/)

    Azure Resource Manager enables you to work with your Azure resources in your solution using the
    Azure Resource Manager deployment model. You can deploy, update, or delete all the resources
    for your solution in a single, coordinated operation.

* [Azure Service Management](/powershell/servicemanagement/)

    Azure Service Management helps you manage your applications, hosted services, and storage
    accounts using the Service Management deployment model.

* [Azure Storage](/powershell/storage/)

    Azure Storage is the cloud storage solution for modern applications that rely on durability,
    availability, and scalability to meet your needs. Storage supports Blob storage, File storage,
    Queue storage, and Table storage.
